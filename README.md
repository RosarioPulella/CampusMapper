# Idea
Many campuses provide numerous static resources that are have relations to each other,
this aims to relate various maintainable resources on an user defined interactive map of the campus.

## User driven
Administrators use provided tools to maintain and provide maps and floor plans,
as well tools to add other related useful information for students.

## Map
The map consists of a one or more campus maps.
Each campus map can have sub maps for floor plans of buildings or what ever detail structure.
Building can have multiple maps for each floor.
Areas of the maps can be interactive, providing information on the region or linking or relating to other information.
